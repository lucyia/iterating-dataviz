# Dataviz prototype

_**NOTE**_: this repository is just an illustration of the approach mentioned in my talk:

[Iterating dataviz with designers in the loop](https://slides.com/lucyia/iterating-dataviz-with-designers-in-loop)

The sample data is made up.

## V0.6.1_squares

![](0.6.1_squares.svg)

## Mappings
* Square: level 1 and level 2
* Position: hierarchy - elements contained within parent

## Discussion
* Exploring different shapes and positions

## Next steps
* Adding more meaningful data attribute to position of shapes
